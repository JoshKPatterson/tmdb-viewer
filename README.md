# What is it?
This project is a web application used to look up information about movies and TV shows, based on the [TMDb database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US).
# What technologies are involved?
This project has a number of technologies involved, including:

 - React
 - Redux
 - React Hooks
 - Axios
 - redux-thunk
# What does it show?
This project demonstrates my (Joshua Patterson) ability to use various React Hooks such as useState and useEffect, connect a Redux store to a react application, connect an API to a front-end, use axios and redux-thunk to asynchronously store fetched data into a Redux reducer, create validation logic and create pagination from scratch.

All work involved in this project is my (Joshua Patterson) own code, written entirely from scratch.
# Will you accept pull requests?
Not at this time, as with the other projects on this profile they are to demonstrate proficiency over their respective components. However, feedback on how to improve/expand projects will always be welcome.
